1. START
2. If the list is empty, then the program is returned.
3. If the list is not empty, we traverse the list using a 
   current pointer that is set to the head pointer and create 
   another pointer previous that points to the last node.
4. Suppose the list has only one node, the node is deleted 
   by setting the head pointer to NULL.
5. If the list has more than one node and the first node is to 
   be deleted, the head is set to the next node and the previous
   is linked to the new head.
6. If the node to be deleted is the last node, link the preceding 
   node of the last node to head node.
7. If the node is neither first nor last, remove the node by 
   linking its preceding node to its succeeding node.
